C/C++ Maven Plugin Suite
========================

The **C/C++ Maven Plugin Suite** consists of three plugins for 
compiling and linking, testing and packaging C/C++ projects.
The plugins emphasize performance, multi target support and
convention over configuration

Background
----------
The plugin suite was originally developed at Ericsson as 
a prototype for simplifying complex multi target make systems.
It was released as open source, under the Apache 2.0 license,
and uploaded to GitHub in 2012.

Usage
-----
Help on using the plugins can be obtained through the **help**
mojos of each plugin, and through the plugin sites.
